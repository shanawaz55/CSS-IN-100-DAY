SVG & canvas - HTML5 Graphics.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
The HTML5 <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics. It provides several methods for drawing boxes, paths, text, circles, and graphic images.
SVG is beneficial as nowadays, people are using high-resolution devices (iPads and Monitors), so it becomes impressive as designs, logos, 
and charts scale according to the requirement, maintaining the picture quality.
SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. It treats every shape as an object. If the user changes the 
attributes of any SVG object, the browser will automatically re-render the shape.

It is a rectangular area on the HTML page for drawing graphics on the fly, using JavaScript.
The default size of the canvas is 300 PX × 150 PX (width × height).
The HTML tag <canvas> is a container for the Canvas graphics. Canvas gets executed on the pixel by pixel basis.
In Canvas, browser forgets the graphic, after drawing it. If the user tries to modify it, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including all the objects present in the graphic.
